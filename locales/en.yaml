  <b>Hey! 👋</b>
  I will add <u>reactions</u> to your posts on the channel along with <u>native comments</u>. It's enough just to add me to your channel, give me permission to edit messages, and also add me to the group that is tied to the channel.

  • If you do not want me to change all messages or want to change emoji, then click the buttons below or send the command /channels to configure. <i>To display a channel in the list, you must first write any post.</i>

  <b>• Need help or have a suggestion?</b> Write to me: @Ly_OBot. Please write immediately what you are talking about and use English or Russian.
